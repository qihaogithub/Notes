## Overall Direction

• Keep the instantly recognizable Jurassic Park identity (T-rex logo, rugged off-road silhouette) yet make each paint job read differently from a distance.  
• Dominant palette: warm sand (#C0B089), deep crimson red (#AA0010), carbon black (#000). Use 5 %–10 % metallic graphite as an accent only where noted.  
• Finishes: body = satin / semi-matte (better toy durability), bumpers & roll cage = matte black, logos = gloss spot-varnish for pop.  
• Resolution for concept sheets: **1536 × 1024 px** (widescreen lets you present 3 angles side-by-side without crowding).
