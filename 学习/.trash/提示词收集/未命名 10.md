## Recommended Image Resolution

Use 1024 × 1024 px.  
A square canvas comfortably frames the toy Jeep in a three-quarter view, allows simultaneous visibility of hood, doors, and fenders, and matches most e-commerce listing ratios without wasting pixels.

## Shared Design System & Color Rules

• Base color: clean white plastic.  
• Accent palette (max 40 % coverage): light sand (#D8CDB6), vivid red (#C32026), deep black (#000000).  
• Finishes: semi-gloss paint for body, matte for graphics to reduce glare, gloss clear coat overall.  
• Graphic style: bold, flat, highly readable at small scale (child’s hand).  
• Placement logic (see reference Jeep proportions):  
– Hood and roof = main “billboard” areas.  
– Door panels & rear quarter = secondary storytelling zones.  
– Fenders & wheel rims = quick-read accent pops.  
– Spare-tire cover (if any) = logo/face-on moment.  
• Absolutely no circular T-rex logo, red-yellow gradients, or Jurassic Park wordmarks.
